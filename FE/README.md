# TODO Application

## Description

This React application is a robust task management tool designed to allow users to add, delete, and manage tasks. The application leverages a custom-built backend using MongoDB and Express to handle CRUD operations and manage task states ("Pending," "In Progress," "Done"). The frontend is developed with React and TypeScript, showcasing dynamic state management and real-time UI updates.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Users can create new tasks via a modal form interface.
- **Delete Tasks:** Allows users to delete tasks using a delete icon associated with each task.
- **Update Task Status:** Users can update task statuses, toggling between "Pending," "In Progress," and "Done."
- **Real-Time UI Updates:** Uses React's state management and `@formkit/auto-animate` for smooth animations during UI updates.
- **Responsive Design:** The interface is responsive and functional on a wide range of devices, from mobile phones to desktops.

## Technologies

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static type definitions.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js, designed for building web applications and APIs.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store application data.
- **Moment.js**: A library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and displaying dates and times in JavaScript.
- **@formkit/auto-animate**: A library for automating animations in React components.
